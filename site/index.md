Coolforms is a form generation library for Angularjs, enabling the develloper to dynamically genreate sophisticated forms. Forms are defined through a JSON definitions file, that could be fetched from a web service or provided as a Javascript object.

### Features

* Form rendering from a definition JSON service or a Javascript object
* Form validation with a set of built-in validators, as well as user defined validators
* Builtin fields and the possibility to add your own set of fields
* Wizard or simple page rendrering
* Posting data to a server
* Fully costomizable templates based on Bootstrap
* Conditionnal display of fields
* Custom POST headers (ex: for Cross Site Request Forgery protection)
